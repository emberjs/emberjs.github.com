    <h1>Ember Data Progress Update</h1>
      <h3 class="blog-post-author">Posted By: Tom Dale &ndash; <time>May 03, 2013</time></h3>

    <hr>

    <p>Just over a month ago, we told you about our <a href="/blog/2013/03/22/stabilizing-ember-data.html">plans for stabilizing Ember
Data</a>. I&#39;d like
to give you an update on the status of those efforts.</p>

<p>First, though, I&#39;d like to thank everyone who has been contributing to Ember
Data. As an open source project, a healthy, active community is our
lifeblood. In particular, I want to call out Igor Terzic, Stefan Penner,
Paul Chavard and Gordon Hempton for going above and beyond the call of
duty.</p>

<p>Thanks to their efforts, <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/pulse/monthly">we&#39;ve been making steady progress towards
triaging and reviewing pull requests and
issues</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, Yehuda and I have been able to devote significant time to
working on Ember Data thanks to the financial support of
<a href="http://www.addepar.com">Addepar</a>. They have my sincere thanks for being
a company that understands the importance of investing in open source.</p>
<h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_a-new-focus'>A New Focus</h3>
<p>Imagine that you are starting a new job as a developer on an existing
server-side web application. On the first day, you begin the process of
familiarizing yourself with the codebase.</p>

<p>Since you have experience with the server-side MVC framework that this
company uses, it&#39;s pretty easy going. You see that the templates are
cleanly separated from the controller logic, which is itself cleanly
separated from the models.</p>

<p>But, wait: something looks amiss in the model code. You take a closer look.</p>

<p>Instead of using an ORM (like ActiveRecord), which queries the database
for you and automatically turns the results into objects, it looks like
they&#39;re issuing queries manually.</p>

<p><em>&quot;No problem,&quot;</em> you think, <em>&quot;I can write SQL with my eyes closed.&quot;</em></p>

<p>But something doesn&#39;t look quite right. Upon closer examination, you see
that database queries aren&#39;t written in SQL, but some query language
you&#39;ve never seen before.</p>

<p>You go to your manager&#39;s office and ask her about it.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot;</em> she says, <em>&quot;We didn&#39;t have time to learn how to setup an
existing database, and our needs were pretty simple at the time. We
decided to roll our own, lightweight database with a simplified query
language.  I guess it sort of just grew over time as our needs grew.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Horrified, you tell her that you don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be a good
fit, turn in your badge, and head to your car.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when you land your next job, the above scenario plays out
all over again. Instead of using SQL, you discover that they too have rolled
their own custom, ad hoc querying language! This repeats, over and over,
until your descent into madness is complete and you retire to a cabin in
the woods.</p>

<p>While this hopefully sounds like something out of a nightmare, the sad
fact is that this is precisely the state of the art when it comes to
writing web JSON APIs. Whether you&#39;re writing an Ember.js application, a
mobile app for Android or iOS, or a desktop app, anything that consumes
a web API typically has to deal with URL patterns and JSON structures that are
ad hoc and informally-specified.</p>

<p><strong>This is bad.</strong> Even though we have figured out a standard way of
describing models and their relationships on the server, getting them
into the browser requires every developer write custom, imperative
code. <strong>It&#39;s a colossal waste of human time and energy.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/most-web-architectures.png" alt="A diagram showing most current web architectures. A conventional MVC
server framework asks for records from a database using a standardized
query language (SQL). A conventional client-side MVC app, however, uses
ad hoc JavaScript to retrieve records from the same web server. An
illustrated picture of Jackie Chan looking frustrated appears to the
right."></p>

<p>The good news is that the solution should now appear obvious: if you
have a conventional framework on the server and a conventional framework
on the client, they should be able to communicate, automatically, using
a standard interchange format.</p>

<p>The reality, however, is that Ember.js developers need to use existing
APIs that aren&#39;t 100% consistent. While we were building towards the
future, we were also trying to build something that could be used in the
interim. In retrospect, trying to serve two masters simply muddled our
message, confused users, and complicated the architecture.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>Ember Data will now focus on being the best possible library
for Ember.js apps to communicate with consistent, conventional APIs.</strong></p>

<p>We will leave bridging the gap in the very capable hands of simpler
libraries that require less conceptual overhead to work with custom JSON
APIs, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ebryn/ember-model">ember-model</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/endlessinc/ember-restless">ember-restless</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/charlieridley/emu">emu</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear: Ember Data will not be limited to one <em>particular</em>
convention. We are excited to see the number of third-party adapters,
such as those for
<a href="https://github.com/clintjhill/ember-parse-adapter">Parse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/toranb/ember-data-django-rest-adapter">Django</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-localstorage-adapter">localStorage</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/thomasboyt/ember-firebase-adapter">Firebase</a>,
continue to grow. The only important feature is that the interchange
between Ember Data and the backend be consistent across all models and
their relationships.</p>
<h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_what-does-this-mean'>What Does This Mean?</h3>
<p>Most users of Ember Data will not have to make any changes to their
application. If you are using the REST adapter with something like the
<code>ActiveModel::Serializers</code> gem in Ruby on Rails, you will continue to not
have to write any network code—defining your schema in JavaScript is
enough for us to know how to load data from the server.</p>

<p>The only notable immediate change is that we will be removing the
<code>BasicAdapter</code> that we described in last month&#39;s blog post. This adapter
was designed to be a stopgap measure to help people use Ember Data with
ad hoc JSON APIs, but we committed the cardinal sin of inventing an API
instead of extracting it from a real application as we usually do.</p>

<p>Developers who had tried out the <code>BasicAdapter</code> appreciated our efforts, but
found it lacking in several important areas. We believe focus is
important, so we will be focusing our efforts on conventional APIs and
will leave the cases previously covered by the <code>BasicAdapter</code> to other
libraries.</p>

<p>The other change is that we will be updating the documentation on the
Ember.js website to reflect this new focus, as well as providing
documentation on how to connect Ember apps to less well-defined JSON
APIs.</p>
<h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_json-api'>JSON API</h3>
<p>In order for Ember Data apps to communicate with a server automatically,
the interchange format must be semantically rich enough to capture all
of the changes to models and their relationships that you may make on
the client.</p>

<p>Over time, we have been building more functionality into the JSON
format used by the <code>RESTAdapter</code>. We have decided to formalize this
JSON format so that any backend, whether it be Ruby on Rails, Django,
node.js, or your other favorite server technology, can interact with
Ember.js apps without users having to write network code.</p>

<p>We have begun the process of documenting this format at
<a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSONAPI.org</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/brixen">Brian
Shirai</a>. This is a living document that
formally describes the JSON format we hope that the authors of
server-side frameworks will use to get seamless compatibility with
Ember.js applications. And, of course, other JavaScript framework are
encouraged to adopt this format so that they can get the same benefit.</p>

<p>Because the best standards are driven by real implementations, <a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik">Steve
Klabnik</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/spastorino">Santiago
Pastorino</a> (both major contributors to
Ruby on Rails) have volunteered to integrate this specification into the
<code>rails-api</code> and <code>ActiveModel::Serializers</code> projects. This
proof-of-concept will allow us to verify the specification is solving
real-world problems.</p>

<p>This work will make it extremely simple for Ember.js developers to
integrate with Ruby on Rails, and we hope other server-side frameworks
vendors follow suit.</p>

<p>Of course, the <code>RESTAdapter</code> will continue to be configurable, so if you
want to use a JSON API that differs from the default specification, but
is still consistent across all of your models, you don&#39;t have to write
an adapter from scratch.</p>
<h3 class='anchorable-toc' id='toc_regular-releases'>Regular Releases</h3>
<p>Now that Ember Data is stabilizing rapidly, we will start doing regular
beta releases to make it easier for users to communicate about different
versions. The first release, which we&#39;ll be releasing in the next few
days, will be version 0.13. In keeping with the <a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer
standard</a>, we reserve the right to change public
APIs until we reach a 1.0.0 candidate. That being said, we will try our
best to continue keeping the app-facing API stable.</p>

<p>We&#39;re excited about the future of Ember Data. In the same way we fought
for strong application architecture conventions in the browser, we will
continue to fight for better compatibility between the client and
server. Hopefully soon, writing low-level XHR code will be an optional
optimization, not a requirement.</p>
